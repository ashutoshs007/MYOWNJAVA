//Static method cannot access instance variables

static keyword means - you are making something as a class member not an object member

static variables are actually shared by different objects and if you want  to refer to a static variable,you can use classname.variable


//in non-static methods ,we can use static variable



//whenever you want to work with non-static method you need to create an object of it, ofc if you want to call 




Constructor:-
//in constructor ,we do not specift return type

//in constructor- (a special method having same name as class name) ,we do not specift return type

//a constructor never returns anyting

//we can write the connection of database in the constructor

Ambiguity problem in image 3 ,like in multiple inheritence if 

class c has to coose a method which is in bot ha  and b and if c is extending both a and b then if we create an object of c and calls obj.show() where show() is in both a  and b then it will be confusion to call which show() ,a one or b one?? confusion ?? and this problem is called ambiguity problem.   so in java multiple inheritence d0 not work.
