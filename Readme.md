      Polymorphism:-many behaviour

same person Many          Behaviour at office ,at office ,with friends


the same object or reference will have different behaviour
based on how you create the instance of it

Types of polymorphism:-
1.Compile time Polymorphism
(Early binding)

-behaviour is defined at compiled time

Method Overloading(which method to execute will be decided at compield time )

add(int,int)
add(int,int,int)



2.Run time Polymorphism
(Late binding)
--behaviour is defined at run time

Method Overriding
{
    2 CLASS, A AND B

    B extends A 

    add(int,int)
    add(int,int)

    out of these two merhods ,wich one will get executed ,it will be decided at runtime 
}
