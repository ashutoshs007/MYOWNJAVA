//Static method cannot access instance variables

static keyword means - you are making something as a class member not an object member

static variables are actually shared by different objects and if you want  to refer to a static variable,you can use classname.variable


//in non-static methods ,we can use static variable



//whenever you want to work with non-static method you need to create an object of it, ofc if you want to call

//in constructor ,we do not specift return type

//in constructor- (a special method having same name as class name) ,we do not specift return type
jh
//a constructor never returns anyting

//we can write the connection of database in the constructor
